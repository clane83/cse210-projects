// Distance (km) = swimming laps * 50 / 1000
// Distance (miles) = swimming laps * 50 / 1000 * 0.62
// Speed (mph or kph) = (distance / minutes) * 60
// Pace (min per mile or min per km)= minutes / distance
// Speed = 60 / pace
// Pace = 60 / speed

// In addition, your program must:

// Use inheritance to avoid duplicating shared attributes and methods.
// Use method overriding for the calculation methods.
// Follow the principles of encapsulation, making sure each member variable is private.
